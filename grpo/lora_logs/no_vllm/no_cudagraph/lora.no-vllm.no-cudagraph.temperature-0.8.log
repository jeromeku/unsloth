We need to count the number of times the letter 'r' appears in the word "strawberry". Let's go through the word character by character:

1. s
2. t
3. r
4. a
5. w
6. b
7. a
8. r
9. r
10. e
11. r

We can see that the letter 'r' appears 3 times in the word "strawberry". The word "strawberry" is 8 letters long, and 'r' appears 3 times. In "strawberry", 'r' appears at positions 3, 8, and 11.
