How many r's are in strawberry?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<reasoning>
To determine how many r's are in the word "strawberry," I need to count each occurrence of the letter 'r' within the word.
Let's go through the word:
s-t-r-a-w-b-e-r-r-y
The letter 'r' appears in the following positions: 3, 5, and 8.
Thus, there are 3 occurrences of the letter 'r' in the word "strawberry."
