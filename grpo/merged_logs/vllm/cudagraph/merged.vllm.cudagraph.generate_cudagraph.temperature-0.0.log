This may lead to unexpected consequences if the model is not static. To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

To determine how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word "strawberry," we can go through the word character by character and count each occurrence of 'r'.

1. The first character is 's', not 'r'.
2. The second character is 't', not 'r'.
3. The third character is 'r', this is the first occurrence of 'r'.
4. The fourth character is 'w', not 'r'.
5. The fifth character is 'a', not 'r'.
6. The sixth character is 'r', this is the second occurrence of 'r'.
7. The seventh character is 'r', this is the third occurrence of 'r'.
8. The eighth character is 'b', not 'r'.
9. The ninth character is 'b', not 'r'.
10. The tenth character is 'e', not 'r'.

After examining all the characters in the word "strawberry," we find that the letter 'r' appears 3 times.
