<reasoning>
To determine how many times the letter 'r' appears in the word "strawberry", we can go through the word character by character and count each occurrence of 'r'. 

- The first character is 's', not 'r'.
- The second character is 't', not 'r'.
- The third character is 'r', this is the first occurrence of 'r'.
- The fourth character is 'w', not 'r'.
- The fifth character is 'a', not 'r'.
- The sixth character is 'r', this is the second occurrence of 'r'.
- The seventh character is 'r', this is the third occurrence of 'r'.
- The eighth character is 'b', not 'r'.
- The ninth character is 'b', not 'r'.
- The tenth character is 'e', not 'r'.

By counting, we find that the letter 'r' appears 3 times in the word "strawberry".
